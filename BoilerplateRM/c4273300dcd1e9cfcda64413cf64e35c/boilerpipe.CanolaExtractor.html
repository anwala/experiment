a deal that seemed impossible months earlier, say people familiar with <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> matter. The <span style="background-color: yellow">Indiana</span>
governor was offering $7 million over 10 years to encourage the company to keep in
the state roughly one-third of the 2,100 jobs it planned to ship to Mexico. <span style="background-color: yellow">United</span>
Technologies would also get credit from the state for keeping 300 research and headquarters jobs
that it didn’t plan to shift abroad. Mr. Hayes’ <span style="background-color: yellow">pilgrimage</span> to <span style="background-color: yellow">Trump</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">Tower</span> ended roughly
two weeks of intensive talks between representatives of Mr. Pence and United Technologies, the Farmington,
Conn., parent of air conditioner and furnace maker Carrier. The agreement was touted by both
sides Thursday. People familiar with the negotiations said the company and Mr. Pence’s team also
discussed a wide range of priorities, including United Technologies’ interest in a corporate tax overhaul,
and regulations the company feels have been a burden to its business. Mr. Pence admitted
on Thursday that he hadn’t thought the company would reverse course, saying it was clear
at a March meeting with Carrier officials that “the die was cast.” Instead of keeping
the factory open, he negotiated in the spring for the company to pay back about
$1.5 million in city and state incentives. The company’s February decision to close a Carrier
plant in Indianapolis became a national issue <span style="background-color: yellow">after</span> a video of a manager announcing the
layoffs went viral. Mr. Trump seized on the moment to rally supporters as part of
his campaign to protect U.S. manufacturing jobs. He brought it up days later at a
Republican presidential debate. At a March 7 rally in Concord, N.C., Mr. Trump said he
would intervene and call Carrier’s CEO. “Somehow it is not presidential for the president of
the United States to call up some guy at Carrier, and say, ‘This is the
president of the United States.’ Who cares?” he told supporters. During the summer, however, with
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leading in most national polls, the company and its union workers
moved ahead with plans to wind down operations over three years. Workers from Mexico would
visit to measure equipment that was being moved to Monterrey. <span style="background-color: yellow">In</span> July, the union worked
out a severance agreement with the company. Click For Sound After publicly shaming Carrier Corp.
throughout the presidential campaign, Donald Trump announced a deal on Thursday with the company’s parent
to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana in exchange for state tax breaks. Is this model
repeatable with other companies? WSJ’s Jason Bellini has #TheShortAnswer. Photo: Getty . But after his
surprise election, Mr. Trump made good on his campaign pledge and phoned Mr. Hayes. “I
called Greg and I said, ‘It’s really important we have to do something because you
have a lot of people leaving,’” Mr. Trump said Thursday, adding that he dismissed the
CEO when Mr. Hayes responded that he had already built a new facility in Mexico.
“Rent it. Sell it or knock it down. I don’t care.” The deal that emerged
this week is a relatively standard package of state incentives, according to people familiar with
the agreement. In exchange for $7 million in tax breaks, Carrier will invest $16 million
in its facilities in the state. The company will keep about 800 jobs it had
planned to move out of the Indianapolis plant, but it still plans to move 600
jobs from that factory to Mexico. United Technologies also will proceed with plans to close
a second plant in Huntington, Ind., that makes electronic controls, moving 700 other jobs to
Mexico. In addition to Carrier, United Technologies makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis
elevators. It employs about 200,000 people, about one-third of them in the U.S. . The
federal government is also an important customer. The U.S. military accounts for about 10% of
United Technologies’ $56 billion in annual sales, for products like the engine for the F-35
Joint Strike Fighter. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee,
said he would be asking more about the Carrier deal and said he would inquire
whether there were promises about defense contracts. Thursday’s plant tour for Mr. Trump was a
victory lap to show that he could deliver on campaign promises. He used the moment
to double down on another one: building a wall on the Mexican border. “Trust me,
we’re going to build a wall.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Mr.
