weeks <span style="background-color: yellow">of</span> intensive talks between representatives of Mr. Pence <span style="background-color: yellow">and</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">United</span> Technologies, <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> Farmington, Conn.,
parent of air conditioner and furnace maker Carrier. The agreement was touted by both sides
Thursday. People familiar with <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> negotiations said <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> company and Mr. Pence’s team also discussed
a wide range of priorities, including <span style="background-color: yellow">United</span> Technologies’ interest <span style="background-color: yellow">in</span> a corporate tax overhaul, and
regulations the company feels have been a burden <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> its business. Mr. Pence admitted <span style="background-color: yellow">on</span>
Thursday that he hadn’t thought the company would reverse course, saying it was clear at
a March meeting with <span style="background-color: yellow">Carrier</span> officials that “the die was cast.” Instead of keeping the
factory open, he negotiated <span style="background-color: yellow">in</span> the spring for the company <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> pay back about $1.5
million in city and state incentives. The company’s February decision <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> close a Carrier plant
in Indianapolis became a national issue <span style="background-color: yellow">after</span> a video of a manager announcing the layoffs
went viral. Mr. Trump seized on the moment to rally supporters as part of his
campaign to protect U.S. manufacturing jobs. <span style="background-color: yellow">He</span> brought it up days later at a Republican
presidential debate. At a March 7 rally in Concord, N.C., Mr. Trump said he would
intervene and call Carrier’s CEO. “Somehow it is not presidential for the president of the
United States to call up some guy at Carrier, and say, ‘This is the president
of the United States.’ Who cares?” he told supporters. During the summer, however, with Democratic
nominee Hillary Clinton leading in most national polls, the company and its union workers moved
ahead with plans to wind down operations over three years. Workers from Mexico would visit
to measure equipment that was being moved to Monterrey. <span style="background-color: yellow">In</span> July, the union worked out
a severance agreement with the company. But after his surprise election, Mr. Trump made good
on his campaign pledge and phoned Mr. Hayes. “I called <span style="background-color: yellow">Greg</span> and I said, ‘It’s
really important we have to do something because you have a lot of people leaving,’”
Mr. Trump said Thursday, adding that he dismissed the CEO when Mr. Hayes responded that
he had already built a new facility in Mexico. “Rent it. Sell it <span style="background-color: yellow">or</span> knock
it down. I don’t care.” The deal that emerged this week is a relatively standard
package of state incentives, according to people familiar with the agreement. In exchange for <span style="background-color: yellow">$7</span>
million in tax breaks, Carrier will invest $16 million in its facilities in the state.
The company will keep about 800 jobs it had planned to move out of the
Indianapolis plant, but it still plans to move 600 jobs from that factory to Mexico.
United <span style="background-color: yellow">Technologies</span> also will proceed with plans to close a second plant in Huntington, Ind.,
that makes electronic controls, moving 700 other jobs to Mexico. In addition to Carrier, United
Technologies makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators. It employs about 200,000 people,
about one-third of them in the U.S. The federal government is also an important customer.
The U.S. military accounts for about 10% of United Technologies’ $56 billion in annual sales,
for products like the engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Sen. Ron Wyden of
Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he would be asking more about
the Carrier deal and said he would inquire whether <span style="background-color: yellow">there</span> were promises about defense contracts.
Thursday’s plant tour for Mr. Trump was a victory lap to show that he could
deliver on campaign promises. He used the moment to double down on another one: building
a wall on the Mexican border. “Trust me, we’re going to build a wall.” Corrections
