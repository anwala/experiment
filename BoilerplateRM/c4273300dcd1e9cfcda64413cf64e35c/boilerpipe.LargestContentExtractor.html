15 Click For Sound After publicly shaming <span style="background-color: yellow">Carrier</span> Corp. throughout <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> presidential campaign, <span style="background-color: yellow">Donald</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">Trump</span>
announced <span style="background-color: yellow">a</span> deal <span style="background-color: yellow">on</span> Thursday with <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> company’s parent <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> keep 1,000 jobs <span style="background-color: yellow">in</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">Indiana</span>
<span style="background-color: yellow">in</span> exchange for state tax breaks. Is this model repeatable with other companies? WSJ’s Jason
Bellini has #TheShortAnswer. Photo: Getty . But <span style="background-color: yellow">after</span> his surprise election, <span style="background-color: yellow">Mr.</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">Trump</span> made good
<span style="background-color: yellow">on</span> his campaign pledge <span style="background-color: yellow">and</span> phoned Mr. Hayes. “I called <span style="background-color: yellow">Greg</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">and</span> I said, ‘It’s
really important we have <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> do something because you have a lot <span style="background-color: yellow">of</span> people leaving,’”
Mr. <span style="background-color: yellow">Trump</span> said Thursday, adding that he dismissed <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> CEO when Mr. Hayes responded that
he had already built a <span style="background-color: yellow">new</span> facility <span style="background-color: yellow">in</span> Mexico. “Rent it. Sell it <span style="background-color: yellow">or</span> knock
it down. I don’t care.” The deal that emerged this week is a relatively standard
package <span style="background-color: yellow">of</span> state incentives, according <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> people familiar with <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> agreement. <span style="background-color: yellow">In</span> exchange for <span style="background-color: yellow">$7</span>
million in tax breaks, Carrier will invest $16 million in its facilities in <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> state.
The company will keep about 800 jobs it had planned <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> move <span style="background-color: yellow">out</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">of</span> the
Indianapolis plant, but it still plans to move 600 jobs from that factory to Mexico.
<span style="background-color: yellow">United</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">Technologies</span> also will proceed with plans to close a second plant in Huntington, Ind.,
that makes electronic controls, moving 700 other jobs to Mexico. In addition to Carrier, <span style="background-color: yellow">United</span>
Technologies makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators. It employs about 200,000 people,
about one-third <span style="background-color: yellow">of</span> them in the U.S. ENLARGE . The federal government is also an
important customer. The U.S. military accounts for about 10% of United Technologies’ $56 billion in
annual sales, for products like the engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Sen. Ron
Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he would be asking
more about the Carrier deal and said he would inquire whether <span style="background-color: yellow">there</span> were promises about
defense contracts. Thursday’s plant tour for Mr. Trump was a victory lap to show that
he could deliver on campaign promises. <span style="background-color: yellow">He</span> used the moment to double down on another
one: building a wall on the Mexican border. “Trust me, we’re going to build a
wall.” —Richard Rubin </div></td></tr></table>
