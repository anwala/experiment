a deal that seemed impossible months earlier, say people familiar with the matter. The Indiana
governor was offering $7 million over 10 years to encourage the company to keep in
the state roughly one-third of the 2,100 jobs it planned to ship to Mexico. United
Technologies would also get credit from the state for keeping 300 research and headquarters jobs
that it didn’t plan to shift abroad. Mr. Hayes’ pilgrimage to Trump Tower ended roughly
two weeks of intensive talks between representatives of Mr. Pence and United Technologies, the Farmington,
Conn., parent of air conditioner and furnace maker Carrier. The agreement was touted by both
sides Thursday. People familiar with the negotiations said the company and Mr. Pence’s team also
discussed a wide range of priorities, including United Technologies’ interest in a corporate tax overhaul,
and regulations the company feels have been a burden to its business. More Deal Could
Complicate Firms’ Plans to Move Factories Overseas Trump Starts ‘Thank You’ Tour A Drop in
the Bucket of Factory Job Losses Carrier Agrees to Keep About 1,000 Jobs in Indiana
(Nov. 29) . Mr. Pence admitted on Thursday that he hadn’t thought the company would
reverse course, saying it was clear at a March meeting with Carrier officials that “the
die was cast.” Instead of keeping the factory open, he negotiated in the spring for
the company to pay back about $1.5 million in city and state incentives. The company’s
February decision to close a Carrier plant in Indianapolis became a national issue after a
video of a manager announcing the layoffs went viral. Mr. Trump seized on the moment
to rally supporters as part of his campaign to protect U.S. manufacturing jobs. He brought
it up days later at a Republican presidential debate. At a March 7 rally in
Concord, N.C., Mr. Trump said he would intervene and call Carrier’s CEO. “Somehow it is
not presidential for the president of the United States to call up some guy at
Carrier, and say, ‘This is the president of the United States.’ Who cares?” he told
supporters. During the summer, however, with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leading in most national polls,
the company and its union workers moved ahead with plans to wind down operations over
three years. Workers from Mexico would visit to measure equipment that was being moved to
Monterrey. In July, the union worked out a severance agreement with the company. Your browser

After publicly shaming Carrier Corp. throughout the presidential campaign, Donald Trump announced a deal on
Thursday with the company’s parent to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana in exchange for state
tax breaks. Is this model repeatable with other companies? WSJ’s Jason Bellini has #TheShortAnswer. Photo:
Getty . But after his surprise election, Mr. Trump made good on his campaign pledge
and phoned Mr. Hayes. “I called Greg and I said, ‘It’s really important we have
to do something because you have a lot of people leaving,’” Mr. Trump said Thursday,
adding that he dismissed the CEO when Mr. Hayes responded that he had already built
a new facility in Mexico. “Rent it. Sell it or knock it down. I don’t
care.” The deal that emerged this week is a relatively standard package of state incentives,
according to people familiar with the agreement. In exchange for $7 million in tax breaks,
Carrier will invest $16 million in its facilities in the state. The company will keep
about 800 jobs it had planned to move out of the Indianapolis plant, but it
still plans to move 600 jobs from that factory to Mexico. United Technologies also will
proceed with plans to close a second plant in Huntington, Ind., that makes electronic controls,
moving 700 other jobs to Mexico. In addition to Carrier, United Technologies makes Pratt &#38;
Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators. It employs about 200,000 people, about one-third of them
in the U.S. ENLARGE . The federal government is also an important customer. The U.S.
military accounts for about 10% of United Technologies’ $56 billion in annual sales, for products
like the engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the
top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he would be asking more about the Carrier
deal and said he would inquire whether there were promises about defense contracts. Thursday’s plant
tour for Mr. Trump was a victory lap to show that he could deliver on
campaign promises. He used the moment to double down on another one: building a wall
on the Mexican border. “Trust me, we’re going to build a wall.” —Richard Rubin contributed
