A second cellphone Farook carried was so badly broken by him that investigators could not extract any data. The unlocking of the iPhone 5c that set off a national furor over security and privacy revealed only work-related data from his job as a health inspector, Eimiller said.
“The goal was to exploit all available digital evidence in this case in the event it contained data of investigative value,” Eimiller said.
Sources say the phone, which was owned by San Bernardino County, yielded limited information. It mostly had schedules for Farook’s health inspectors.
Authorities still aren’t exactly sure why the couple made the Christmas party the target of their attack. San Bernardino Police Lt. Mike Madden noted that in 2014, Farook attended another work event in that room, which was decorated for Christmas. Malik later stated on an online account something to the effect that she felt Muslims should not have to attend Christian events, Madden said.
Madden added that she did not specifically mention the event in her posting and that it’s far from clear that it played any role in the attack.
“It is open to speculation why they chose the party,” he said. "I don't know if we can say with any certainty why the party was chosen apart from it was a soft target.”
San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan agreed.
"There are a lot of questions and we don't have all the answers,” he said Thursday. "We never established the motive. The best we can do is theorize.”
Experts said it could take years to better understand how the San Bernardino plot was hatched and carried out. And even then, there will likely be many nagging, unanswered questions.
“The scope of what the San Bernardino couple prepared for is a reason alone for investigators to continue digging,” said Erroll Southers, a former presidential nominee for assistant secretary of the Transportation Security Administrationand a USC professor of homeland security. “In terrorism investigations there can be frustrations. At this point they may have exhausted the electronic trail. But it doesn’t mean they are going to stop.”
