Noah Finds His Late-Night Voice <span style="background-color: yellow">The</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">Daily</span> Show host was measured, respectful, and challenging <span style="background-color: yellow">in</span>
his 26-minute conversation with TheBlaze pundit <span style="background-color: yellow">Tomi</span> Lahren. DAVID SIMS DEC 1, 2016 Tomi Lahren,
the 24-year-old host of Tomi <span style="background-color: yellow">on</span> the conservative cable network TheBlaze, feels like a pundit
created by a computer algorithm, someone who primarily exists <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> say something provocative enough to
jump to the top of a Facebook feed. She’s called the Black Lives Matter movement
“the new KKK,” partly blamed the 2015 Chattanooga shootings on President Obama’s “Muslim sensitivity,” and
declared Colin Kaepernick a “whiny, indulgent, attention-seeking cry-baby.” At a time when such charged political
rhetoric feels increasingly like the norm, <span style="background-color: yellow">Lahren</span> stands at one end of a widening gulf—which
made her appearance on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Wednesday night all the more
fascinating. In his first year at The Daily Show, Noah has struggled to distinguish himself
in an outrage-driven late-night universe. He has sometimes seemed too flip about the failures of
the country’s news media, something his predecessor Jon Stewart made a perennial target. Noah’s 26-minute
conversation with Lahren, though, posted in its entirety online, set the kind of tone that
Stewart frequently called for throughout his tenure. The segment never turned into a screaming match,
but it also avoided platitudes and small-talk. Lahren was unapologetic about her online bombast and
leaned into arguments that drew gasps and boos from Noah’s audience, but the host remained
steadfastly evenhanded throughout. If Noah was looking for a specific episode that would help him
break out in his crowded field, he may have finally found it. The Anger of
Samantha Bee Lahren first made a name for herself in 2015 with her commentary on
the Chattanooga shootings for the network OAN. At the age of 22, she seemed poised
to become a star who could appeal to young conservatives online, the kind of firebrand
who could stick out in a social-media feed. “I care that our commander-in-chief is more
concerned with Muslim sensitivity than the honor and sacrifice made by these Marines,” she said.
In the same segment, she also somehow implicated President Obama’s actions on issues like climate
change and universal healthcare in an act committed by a man diagnosed with bipolar disorder
who was seemingly radicalized by online propaganda. “Why are you so angry?” Noah asked Lahren
as she sat down, referring to the biting tone she often uses in her broadcast.
He seemed to be getting at other questions, too: Does anger like Lahren’s, delivered in
bite-size, shareable video clips eagerly devoured by a certain segment of the population, exist only
to grab their attention? Is it a more extreme example of the “Samantha Bee problem”
that Ross Douthat claimed hurt the Clinton campaign—that overt activism was getting injected into previously
mainstream areas of the media like late-night comedy? Noah has largely steered clear of giving
lectures straight to the camera, perhaps because hosts like Seth Meyers and John Oliver have
staked out that territory so well. In talking with Lahren, he seemed interested in going
a more conciliatory, diplomatic route. Still, Noah wasn’t afraid to challenge his guest, including on
her widely criticized comment that the Black Lives Matter movement was the “next KKK” because
of some violent anti-police rhetoric from isolated members of the movement. “Just because you say
the thing doesn’t mean that’s what it stands for,” Noah said exasperatedly. “You’ve argued on
your show, just because Donald Trump has KKK supporters doesn’t mean he’s in the KKK.”
Indeed, minutes later she angrily refuted the idea that she or Trump belonged to the
white supremacist alt-right, just because that group supported him. In the wake of the 2016
election, even a bare minimum of respectful discourse stands out. “Surely you understand the incendiary
feeling of your comments, surely?” Noah pleaded. “It’s controversial, but I think there are some
things that need to be said,” Lahren countered. Her point, it seems, is the foundation
for so much in the factionalized world of social media-driven news. If something is controversial,
is it defensible simply because it “needed” to be said? Her argument is rooted in
the First Amendment, which Lahren kept referencing, but Noah remarked on some inconsistencies in her
views on free speech. Lahren has criticized the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for
his kneeling protest during the national anthem—but Noah noted the parallels between Lahren’s professed right
to criticize Kaepernick and Kaepernick’s right to not kneel. Toward the end, Noah crystallized his
point without having to yell it at the audience like some of his late-night peers:
He tried to get a genuine answer from Lahren on a much more nuanced query
relating to Kaepernick’s protest. “Here’s a black man who says, ‘I don’t know how to
get this message across. If I march in the streets people say I’m a thug.
If I go out and protest, people say it’s a riot. If I go down
on one knee, it’s wrong,’” Noah said. “What is the right way, I’ve always wanted
to know, what is the right way for a black person to get attention in
America?” Lahren didn’t give a full answer, but Noah kept coming around to the same
idea, trying to untangle the baffling contradictions he’s noticed in the country’s political discourse. The
interview was frustrating in that it produced few answers to the questions Noah and Lahren
lobbed at each other. Every topic of conversation, from Black Lives Matter to immigration reform,
ended with the pair politely agreeing to disagree. But in the wake of the 2016
election, even that bare minimum of respectful discourse stands out—as Lahren later said on Twitter,
neither side resorted to name-calling, but on social media afterward, the personal insults began flying
between each of their supporters. Noah’s approach was memorable both for how measured it felt
and for how quickly it moved to more complicated topics. Even if the interview didn’t
find much common ground, it was an encouraging, intelligent step forward for Noah as he
charts a course for his show in the coming year. </div></td><td><h3>gold standard over clean_html()</h3><div><span style="background-color: yellow">Trevor</span>
