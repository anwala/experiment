Getty Images ISTANBUL — Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated at an Ankara art exhibit
on Monday evening by a lone Turkish gunman shouting “God is great!” and “don’t forget
Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!” in what Russia called a terrorist attack. The gunman, who was
described by Ankara’s mayor as a policeman, also wounded at least three others in the
assault, which was captured on Turkish video. Turkish officials said he was killed by other
officers in a shootout. The assassination instantly vaulted relations between Turkey and Russia to a
new level of crisis over the protracted Syria conflict on Turkey’s southern doorstep. It came
after days of protests by Turks angry over Russia’s support for Syria’s government in the
conflict and the Russian role in the killings and destruction in Aleppo, the northern Syrian
city. Andrey Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, speaking at the gallery in Ankara on

was shot from behind and immediately fell to the floor while speaking at an exhibition,
according to multiple accounts from the scene, the Contemporary Arts Center in the Cankaya area
of Ankara. The gunman, wearing a dark suit and tie, was seen in video footage
of the assault shouting in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad
for jihad. God is great!” Then he switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo,
don’t forget Syria! Step back! Step back! Only death can take me from here.” Turkish
officials said that the gunman was killed after a shootout with Turkish Special Forces police.

news channel that Mr. Karlov had died of his wounds in what she described as
a terrorist attack. Russia news agencies said the ambassador’s wife fainted and was hospitalized after
learning of her husband’s death. They also said Russian tourists in Turkey had been advised
against leaving their hotel rooms or visiting public places as a precaution. CNN Turk published
images showing several people lying on the floor of the gallery. Russia’s Tass news agency
initially quoted witnesses of the attack as saying that there had been an “assassination attempt”
against Mr. Karlov, and that he had been shot from behind while finishing his opening
remarks at the opening of the exhibition, called “Russia Through Turks’ Eyes.” While the Russian
and Turkish governments back different sides in the Syria conflict, they had been collaborating in
recent days in efforts to evacuate civilians from Aleppo. The gunman gestures after shooting the

in 1976, worked extensively in North Korea over two decades, before moving to the region
in 2007, according to a biography on the Russian Embassy’s website. He became ambassador in
July 2013. The attack was a rare instance of an assassination of any Russian envoy.
Historians said it might have been the first since Pyotr Voykov, a Soviet ambassador to
Poland, was shot to death in Warsaw in 1927. For many Russians, the assassination is
likely to recall the 19th-century killing in Tehran of Aleksandr Griboyedov, a poet and diplomat
who died after a mob stormed the Russian Embassy. That episode is remembered as the
most severe insult to Russia’s diplomatic corps in the country’s history. More recently, the Lebanese
Shiite militia Hezbollah, now allied with Russia in Syria, kidnapped four Soviet diplomats in 1985,
killing one and releasing three a month later. Correction: December 19, 2016 An earlier version
of this article misidentified the government that has collaborated with Russia even though it backs
a different side in the Syrian conflict. It is Turkey, not Syria. Tim Arango reported
