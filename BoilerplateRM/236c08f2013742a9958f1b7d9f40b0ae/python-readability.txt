I try to get up early, work out in the morning, and get it over and done with. If I wait for the evening, it’s not going to happen. So, I wake up and have a protein shake. I’ll put in banana, chocolate whey powder, peanut butter, strawberries, and almond milk. I like the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Isopure-Protein-Powder-Chocolate-Pounds/dp/B000E8ZJGS" target="_blank"> Isopure chocolate whey powder</a>; it’s one of the cleanest ones. Then I’ll have breakfast, which is usually two hard-boiled eggs with spinach.</p>

I balance it with working out. But generally, I try to be very clean and eat healthy, and always have a lot of protein. I do have a lot of cheat days. I feel like you should be able to eat what you want.</p>

For a while when I was modeling, I completely stopped working out. I thought,<em> I’m fine, I don’t have to work out, I have a fast metabolism</em>. But feeling really strong has changed my mind-set so much. You feel really good.</p>

I work out about four times a week. I love doing barre classes once a week. I do <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/01/workout-gifs-easy-at-home-thigh-moves.html" target="_blank">Physique 57</a>. Their class is less cardio-based — it’s slower. I love doing Pilates on a reformer for tightening and lightening. Twice a week,  I’ll do weight training to build thighs and bulk up a little more. I’ll go to Dogpound. They really listen to you and what you want to accomplish. And for me, I want to build my legs and my butt. That’s always a goal. I love a bigger butt.</p>

Some people might bulk up with doing heavy weight lifting, but I don’t. I would say, try it once a week. Add more lengthening and Pilates and see if you see a difference.  For me, personally, because of my metabolism, I try to stay far away from cardio for my body type. I also need a lot of protein. It’s the only way for me to maintain my body.</p>

I remind myself to do it. I also go with friends. If I sign up with <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2011/08/meet_the_new_girl_josephine_sk.html" target="_blank">Josephine [Skriver] </a>or <a href="http://nymag.com/fashion/models/rstrijd/romeestrijd/" target="_blank">Romee [Strijd]</a>, I can’t say no. Josephine and I created an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joja/" target="_blank">Instagram account called @Joja</a> to show people what to do. We love working out together. We mostly do it ourselves or have a photographer snap a few images.</p>

I don’t work out based on my job. I work out based on what makes me feel good. If the client doesn’t like that, they can go find someone else. I’ve always had a very strong mind-set. I’ve never compared myself to anyone.</p>

You can do things in your hotel room. I bring my ankle weights so I can do a few butt workouts. If I don’t, I lose the momentum and take two to three weeks off.</p>
