San Francisco bank said that while it <span style="background-color: yellow">is</span> planning <span style="background-color: yellow">for</span> a variety <span style="background-color: yellow">of</span> different scenarios
<span style="background-color: yellow">surrounding</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">the</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">fate</span> of the <span style="background-color: yellow">rule,</span> it is preparing <span style="background-color: yellow">as</span> if the rule <span style="background-color: yellow">will</span> be
implemented <span style="background-color: yellow">in</span> April as scheduled. “While there is a great deal of speculation <span style="background-color: yellow">in</span> the
media <span style="background-color: yellow">on</span> how the election results will affect the DOL <span style="background-color: yellow">rule,</span> none of us can
say <span style="background-color: yellow">with</span> certainty what will actually happen,” <span style="background-color: yellow">Wells</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">Fargo</span> said in a memorandum, reviewed by
<span style="background-color: yellow">The</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">Wall</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">Street</span> Journal, <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">its</span> more than 15,000 <span style="background-color: yellow">brokers</span> on Thursday. However, <span style="background-color: yellow">Wells</span> clients
in those <span style="background-color: yellow">accounts</span> after April will likely have a slimmer menu of investment products <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span>
choose from, people <span style="background-color: yellow">with</span> knowledge of the matter said, although details weren’t immediately available. Firms
still offering commission-based IRAs have had <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> drop some investment products <span style="background-color: yellow">from</span> them <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">comply</span>
<span style="background-color: yellow">with</span> some restrictions within the rule. Edward Jones, for example, won’t <span style="background-color: yellow">allow</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">retirement</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">savers</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">who</span>
<span style="background-color: yellow">pay</span> a commission <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> buy mutual funds next year, while some alternative investments won’t be
immediately available in commission-based IRAs at Morgan Stanley. <span style="background-color: yellow">The</span> <span style="background-color: yellow">retirement</span> rules—which researcher Morningstar Inc. predicts
will affect about $3 trillion of commission-based <span style="background-color: yellow">retirement</span> assets in the U.S.—bring a host of
changes, including how investors pay for retirement advice, the elimination of compensation incentives for brokers
<span style="background-color: yellow">and</span> higher investment minimums. But since Republicans took the White House and retained control of
Congress, firms now face the dizzying possibility of an outright dismantling of the rule. Congressional
Republicans opposing the rule have seized on Donald Trump’s surprise presidential win as a chance
<span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> stop the regulations <span style="background-color: yellow">ahead</span> of <span style="background-color: yellow">their</span> implementation. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who
heads the House Financial Services Committee, and Rep. Ann Wagner (R., Mo.), who <span style="background-color: yellow">has</span> been
one of the most vocal opponents of the rule, have both said <span style="background-color: yellow">their</span> party will
renew the fight <span style="background-color: yellow">to</span> halt it next year. Republicans challenging the rule have said it
would cut small retirement savers off from affordable financial advice. A recent survey by analytics
firm CoreData Research of 552 financial advisers in the U.S. found that 71% plan to
no longer service some smaller investors because of the rule. Wells <span style="background-color: yellow">Fargo</span> and other <span style="background-color: yellow">brokerages</span>
are moving ahead with implementation <span style="background-color: yellow">despite</span> the uncertainty. But even if the rule is shelved,
certain aspects of it, such as heightened oversight of retirement accounts, will <span style="background-color: yellow">continue</span> to <span style="background-color: yellow">move</span>
forward at Wells Fargo, people familiar with the matter said. For investors, the <span style="background-color: yellow">rule’s</span> halt
may not be that apparent if firms choose to keep some of the changes they’ve
already made or planned. Some companies will be able to implement the rule’s higher standard
of care without the costly <span style="background-color: yellow">compliance</span> requirements, said Kent Mason, a partner at law firm
Davis <span style="background-color: yellow">&</span> Harman LLP who focuses on retirement. “But people may have also lost the
option of choice,” Mr. Mason added, referring to some firms’ decision to no longer offer
commission-based IRAs. “The legacy of the rule may be less access [for small savers] and
less choice.” </div></td></tr></table>
