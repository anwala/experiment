the incoming Trump administration have made it clear that Obama-era regulations are under review for
repeal or replacement. <span style="background-color: yellow">The</span> San Francisco bank said that while it is planning for a
variety of different scenarios surrounding the fate of the <span style="background-color: yellow">rule,</span> it is preparing as if
the rule will be implemented in April as scheduled. “While there is a great deal
of speculation in the media on how the election results will affect the DOL rule,
none of us can say with certainty what will actually happen,” Wells Fargo said in
a memorandum, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, to its more than 15,000 brokers on
Thursday. Wells Fargo’s brokerage arm, Wells Fargo Advisors, which has more $1.5 trillion in total
client assets, said it would allow its brokers to continue offering individual retirement accounts that
charge investors per-transaction commissions, an approach toward compliance similar to some brokerages such as Morgan
Stanley and Edward Jones. However, Wells clients in those accounts after April will likely have
a slimmer menu of investment products to choose from, people with knowledge of the matter
said, although details weren’t immediately available. Firms still offering commission-based IRAs have had to drop
some investment products from them to comply with some restrictions within the rule. Edward Jones,
for example, won’t allow retirement savers who pay a commission to buy mutual funds next
year, while some alternative investments won’t be immediately available in commission-based IRAs at Morgan Stanley.
The approach to allow commission offerings differs from rivals Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch
and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., among others. Merrill and J.P. Morgan said in recent
months that they would ditch the industry’s traditional commission-based sales model for retirement accounts and
will effectively offer only IRAs that charge a fee based on a percentage of assets
starting next year. The retirement rules—which researcher Morningstar Inc. predicts will affect about $3 trillion
of commission-based retirement assets in the U.S.—bring a host of changes, including how investors pay
for retirement advice, the elimination of compensation incentives for brokers and higher investment minimums. But
since Republicans took the White House and retained control of Congress, firms now face the
dizzying possibility of an outright dismantling of the rule. Congressional Republicans opposing the rule have
seized on Donald Trump’s surprise presidential win as a chance to stop the regulations ahead
of their implementation. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who heads the House Financial Services
Committee, and Rep. Ann Wagner (R., Mo.), who has been one of the most vocal
opponents of the rule, have both said their party will renew the fight to halt
it next year. Republicans challenging the rule have said it would cut small retirement savers
off from affordable financial advice. A recent survey by analytics firm CoreData Research of 552
financial advisers in the U.S. found that 71% plan to no longer service some smaller
investors because of the rule. Wells Fargo and other brokerages are moving ahead with implementation
despite the uncertainty. But even if the rule is shelved, certain aspects of it, such
as heightened oversight of retirement accounts, will continue to move forward at Wells Fargo, people
familiar with the matter said. For investors, the rule’s halt may not be that apparent
if firms choose to keep some of the changes they’ve already made or planned. Some
companies will be able to implement the rule’s higher standard of care without the costly
compliance requirements, said Kent Mason, a partner at law firm Davis & Harman LLP who
focuses on retirement. “But people may have also lost the option of choice,” Mr. Mason
added, referring to some firms’ decision to no longer offer commission-based IRAs. “The legacy of
the rule may be less access [for small savers] and less choice.” Write to <span style="background-color: yellow">Michael</span>
