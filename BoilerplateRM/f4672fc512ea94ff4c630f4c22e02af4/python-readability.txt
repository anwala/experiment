<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="6186" id="story-continues-15">The United States, which has tangled bitterly with Russia over the Syrian conflict, quickly condemned the assassination in Ankara. In a <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/12/265774.htm">statement</a>, Secretary of State John Kerry called it a “despicable attack, which was also an assault on the right of all diplomats to safely and securely advance and represent their nations around the world.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="6530" id="story-continues-16">Other prominent officials who often criticize Russia’s actions in Syria and elsewhere also offered their condolences. “No justification for such a heinous act,” Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, said on<a href="https://twitter.com/jensstoltenberg/status/810909064536489984?s=03"> Twitter</a>. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2016-12-19/statement-attributable-spokesman-secretary-general-assassination">said </a>he was “appalled by this senseless act of terror.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="6715" id="story-continues-17">President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has been accused by critics of aligning with Russia, said in a statement that Mr. Karlov had been “assassinated by a radical Islamic terrorist.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="6989">The assassination also illustrated the long reach of the Syrian war. It has destabilized Europe with hundreds of thousands of refugees, spawned terrorist <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/news-event/attacks-in-paris?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Complete coverage of the attacks in Paris." class="meta-classifier">attacks in Paris</a> and Brussels, and led to the rise of the Islamic State, which controls territory across Iraq and Syria.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="377" data-total-count="7366">When the war began, Turkey was rising and confident, and Mr. Erdogan, then its prime minister, began supporting rebels seeking the ouster of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Preoccupied with bringing Mr. Assad down, Turkey opened its borders to weapons and fighters flowing to the rebels, turning a blind eye, for a time, when the opposition turned increasingly Islamist.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="7607">As the war ground on, the consequences for Turkey were profound. It was overwhelmed with refugees — more than three million now reside in the country — and the rise of the Islamic State led to terrorist attacks within Turkey’s borders.</p> <figure id="turkey-terror-attacks-bombings" class="interactive promo  layout-large">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="7918" id="story-continues-18">In the fall of 2015, Russia entered the conflict in support of the Syrian government, reinforcing Mr. Assad at a weak moment and dealing a blow to Turkey’s ambitions in Syria. Relations between Turkey and Russia reached a low point in November 2015 after Turkey shot down a Russian jet near the Syrian border.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="444" data-total-count="8362">But this year, in an effort to restore relations, Mr. Erdogan, now Turkey’s president, met with Mr. Putin in St. Petersburg, and ever since the two countries have largely put aside their differences on Syria and focused on improving economic ties. In August, when Turkey’s military went into Syria to push the Islamic State out of the border town of Jarabulus, the move was widely seen as having been made with the tacit approval of Russia.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="8570">For Turkey, the Ankara attack resonated in the Turkish collective memory: Turkey lost many diplomats in the 20th century to Armenian militants in a campaign to avenge the Armenian genocide during World War I.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="391" data-total-count="8961" id="story-continues-19">“Turkey is very aware of the size of this failure, and I think the government will make every effort to investigate this fully,” Sinan Ulgen, a Turkish former diplomat who is the chairman of the Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies, an Istanbul research organization, said of the Russian diplomat’s assassination. “I don’t expect any crisis between Turkey and Russia.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="318" data-total-count="9279" id="story-continues-20">Since the Turkish military incursion into Syria in August, Mr. Erdogan’s criticism of Russia over Syria had been muted. But Mr. Erdogan faced a dilemma: Even as he was warming to Russia, he faced a Turkish public, not to mention the Syrian refugees within Turkey, angry over Russia’s role in the bombing of Aleppo.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="378" data-total-count="9657">On Monday evening in Istanbul, just after the assassination, a group of protesters gathered outside the Russian consulate on Istiklal Avenue, the city’s largest pedestrian street. The gathering was more street theater than protest, with two men lying on the street, shrouded in bloody sheets and the Syrian flag, and surrounded by candles, to represent the killings in Aleppo.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="136" data-total-count="9793">Mohammed al-Shibli, a Syrian activist who participated, said, “I felt extreme happiness when I heard the news” of the assassination.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="10074" id="story-continues-21">He continued: “This is the first step in getting justice for the Syrian people. The ambassador is not innocent. He represents the foreign policy of his murderous state and thus he is a murderer, as well. Now we are waiting for revenge against everyone who shed blood in Syria.”</p><div id="addenda" class="addenda">

        <p>An earlier version of this article misidentified the government that has collaborated with Russia even though it backs a different side in the Syrian conflict. It is Turkey, not Syria.</p>    </div>
