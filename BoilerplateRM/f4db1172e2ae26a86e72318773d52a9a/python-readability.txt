<p><span/><span><span/>I<span/></span>t does all beg the question as to what purpose the EFL Cup serves, especially when England players look exhausted at every major tournament. There is undoubtedly a need for a winter break in the Premier League, but the powers that be could quite easily cut a possible seven matches from a team's workload by scrapping the EFL Cup. <span/></p>
<p><span/>It is easy to dismiss this point of view as big-team bias, but when you have lower-league teams like Bristol City and Preston North End, among numerous others, effectively changing their entire team for the competition, it's difficult to see who the competition is really for. <span/></p>
<p><span/>It's certainly not for Wenger, who has never won the competition. Wednesday's defeat could prove to be debilitating to Arsenal in that it ended a 19-match unbeaten run, but the burdensome scheduling in England makes a choice like the one Wenger, and the vast majority of his peers have made this season, essential. <span/></p>
<p><span/>Liverpool and Southampton could each play eight matches in January after six and seven respectively in December. It's little wonder most managers have taken evasive EFL Cup action.  <span/></p>
