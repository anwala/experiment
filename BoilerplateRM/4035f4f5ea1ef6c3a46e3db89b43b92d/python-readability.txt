<div><span/><strong><span/>How I start my day<span/></strong><p>: I love to</p><a href="https://archive.is/o/SduYw/nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/11/to-stick-to-a-bedtime-think-of-sleep-like-exercise.html"><span/>
sleep <span/></a><p>in, but I feel good when I get up early and get the day started. I try to get up early, work out in the morning, and get it over and done with. If I wait for the evening, it’s not going to happen. So, I wake up and have a protein shake. I’ll put in banana, chocolate whey powder, peanut butter, strawberries, and almond milk. I like the</p><a href="https://archive.is/o/SduYw/https://www.amazon.com/Isopure-Protein-Powder-Chocolate-Pounds/dp/B000E8ZJGS"><span/>
Isopure chocolate whey powder<span/></a><p>; it’s one of the cleanest ones. Then I’ll have breakfast, which is usually two hard-boiled eggs with spinach.</p><span/></div>
<p><span/>

<span/></p>
<p><span/><strong><span/>On food<span/></strong>: I love to eat tons of food with lots of carbs. I balance it with working out. But generally, I try to be very clean and eat healthy, and always have a lot of protein. I do have a lot of cheat days. I feel like you should be able to eat what you want.<span/></p>
<p><span/><strong><span/>How I like to eat when I’m alone<span/></strong>: Really messy. I love to have hot wings and French fries.<span/></p>
<p><span/><strong><span/>What wellness means to me<span/></strong>: It’s about being the best version of yourself and not comparing yourself to others. Everyone’s body is different.<span/></p>
<p><span/><strong><span/>How wellness changed for me<span/></strong>: Growing up, I did gymnastics for 16 years. For a while when I was modeling, I completely stopped working out. I thought,<em><span/>
I’m fine, I don’t have to work out, I have a fast metabolism<span/></em>. But feeling really strong has changed my mind-set so much. You feel really good.<span/></p>
<div><span/><strong><span/>How I sweat<span/></strong><p>: I like to mix it up. I work out about four times a week. I love doing barre classes once a week. I do
</p><a href="https://archive.is/o/SduYw/nymag.com/thecut/2014/01/workout-gifs-easy-at-home-thigh-moves.html"><span/>Physique 57<span/></a><p>. Their class is less cardio-based — it’s slower. I love doing Pilates on a reformer for tightening and lightening. Twice a week, I’ll do weight training to build thighs and bulk up a little more. I’ll go to Dogpound. They really listen to you and what you want to accomplish. And for me, I want to build my legs and my butt. That’s always a goal. I love a bigger butt.</p><span/></div>

<p><span/>There’s a stigma surrounding heavy weight lifting, but you just have to figure out what’s good for you. Some people might bulk up with doing heavy weight lifting, but I don’t. I would say, try it once a week. Add more lengthening and Pilates and see if you see a difference. For me, personally, because of my metabolism, I try to stay far away from cardio for my body type. I also need a lot of protein. It’s the only way for me to maintain my body.<span/></p>
<div><span/><p>On weekends, it’s so hard to go work out. I remind myself to do it. I also go with friends. If I sign up with
</p><a href="https://archive.is/o/SduYw/nymag.com/thecut/2011/08/meet_the_new_girl_josephine_sk.html"><span/>Josephine [Skriver]
<span/></a><p>or
</p><a href="https://archive.is/o/SduYw/nymag.com/fashion/models/rstrijd/romeestrijd/"><span/>Romee [Strijd]<span/></a><p>, I can’t say no. Josephine and I created an
</p><a href="https://archive.is/o/SduYw/https://www.instagram.com/joja/"><span/>Instagram account called @Joja<span/></a><p>
to show people what to do. We love working out together. We mostly do it ourselves or have a photographer snap a few images.</p><span/></div>
<p><span/>Once you see improvement in your body from working out, you can’t really stop. I don’t work out based on my job. I work out based on what makes me feel good. If the client doesn’t like that, they can go find someone else. I’ve always had a very strong mind-set. I’ve never compared myself to anyone.<span/></p>
<p><span/><strong><span/>My wellness shortcut<span/></strong>: I take a little travel workout pack. You can do things in your hotel room. I bring my ankle weights so I can do a few butt workouts. If I don’t, I lose the momentum and take two to three weeks off.<span/></p>
