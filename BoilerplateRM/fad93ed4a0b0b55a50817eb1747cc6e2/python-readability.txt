He said he had no specifics, including where the body was found or whether the person died in a hospital.</p><p>Authorities haven't said whether they'll be forced to rely on dental records to identify the remains found.</p><p>In Memphis, family announced that Jon and Janet Summers had been confirmed among the dead. The couple and their three grown sons were vacationing outside Gatlinburg and got separated as they fled the flames. The three sons have been recovering from burns in a Nashville hospital.</p><p>Gatlinburg Police Chief Randy Brackins fought back tears at a morning news conference as he described the crawling pace of the process.</p><p>"It's one of the most difficult things you can imagine," he said. "I know you're frustrated. If it were my family members, I'd be frustrated."</p><p>Firefighters and emergency crews continue to work their way through fire-ravaged remote areas of Gatlinburg and surrounding Sevier County amid blocked roads, downed power lines, fallen trees and mudslides. Two of the four zones searched stood at 80% and 90% complete Thursday morning, with the other two expected to be complete by nightfall, Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller said.</p><div id="module-position-Pl3sK0XKOnQ" class="story-asset video-asset"><div class="ui-video-wrapper  " itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><p class="js-video-placeholder video-placeholder smallarticleinlinehtml5"/><div class="ui-video-controls story-video inline-story-video"><p class="video-desc" itemprop="description">

National Guardsmen and Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers fanned out to help conduct health and welfare checks at 74 homes.</p><p>"We're never going to give up hope. I will always hold out hope of a rescue," the fire chief said. "But now we are at hour 65 since the beginning of the fires. We have to come to the realization that the potential is great it will be more of a recovery (of corpses) than a rescue."</p><p>Some of the searchers have lost homes and family members of their own, and most refused to go home despite being told to take breaks, Miller said.</p><div id="module-position-Pl3sK0XUVEU" class="story-asset video-asset"><div class="ui-video-wrapper  " itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><p class="js-video-placeholder video-placeholder smallarticleinlinehtml5"/><div class="ui-video-controls story-video inline-story-video"><p class="video-desc" itemprop="description">

Three more bodies had been found by Wednesday afternoon — all three in a home on Campbell Lead Road.</p><p>Authorities have not provided a list of residents unaccounted for. The TBI has set up a hotline for people to call at 800-TBI-FIND if they believe a loved one is missing.

She gave no details on any specific cases.</p><p>Eighty people have been treated at LeConte Medical Center for fire-related injuries, authorities said, with some still hospitalized. The three Summers sons suffered burns serious enough to need treatment at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p><p>Fire officials said the damage total includes about 300 buildings inside the Gatlinburg city limits and another 400 in neighboring Pigeon Forge and outlying unincorporated communities. That's on top of more than 17,100 acres consumed since the blaze began last week in the remote Chimney Tops area of the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park.</p><div id="module-position-Pl3sK0XtCvM" class="story-asset gallery-asset"><p class="card-film inactive"/><p class="sidebar-gallery-btn active"/><div class="companion-story-gallery"><div class="companion-galleries embedded_story hasendslate galleries" data-gallery-id="94704864" data-title="Photos: Inside the middle of the Gatlinburg wildfire:Photos: Inside the Gatlinburg wildfire" data-seo-title="photos-inside-the-gatlinburg-wildfire" data-ssts="news" data-cst="news" data-published-date="2016-11-30T23:12:35.8000000" data-topic="home,news" data-gal-pageurl="http://www.tennessean.com/picture-gallery/news/2016/11/30/photos-inside-the-middle-of-the-gatlinburg-wildfire/94704864/"><div class="viewport gallery-viewport"><div class="slide gallery-viewport-slide endslate"><div class="gallery-photo-border"><div class="gallery-endslate"><h3 class="gallery-endslate-header">Like this topic?

The fire continued to rage through brush, deadwood and fallen leaves Thursday, and park officials warned recent rains haven't done enough to relieve the four-month drought that made the fire possible.</p><p>"The fire is not out," said Mark Jamieson, chief of the fire management team for the park. "It is just knocked down."</p><p>The U.S Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has joined the "initial stages" of the investigation into the fire's cause, ATF spokesman Michael Knight said. That involvement doesn't necessarily mean the probe will lead to any arrests, he said.</p><p>Since the fire's start Nov. 23 on the Chimney Tops trail, the flames have spread to more than 6,200 acres outside the park. By Monday morning, the flames had spread by embers carried on the wind to the Twin Creeks community but didn't appear to pose an immediate threat to the city, Miller said.</p><div id="module-position-Pl3sK0WhQpE" class="story-asset pullquote-asset"><aside class="pull-quote"><p class="pull-quote-item">“The fire is not out.

"I don't have a great understanding of it myself, because it's so unfathomable."</p><p>The fire displaced more than 14,000 residents from Gatlinburg alone, many of whom fled home Monday night in the dark with nothing more than what they could carry. Most have found lodging with friends or family.</p><p>The head count at emergency shelters Wednesday night had fallen to 240 people, according to the American Red Cross.</p><p>Authorities have reopened access to Gatlinburg from the post office to the eastern city limits and hope to reopen the Parkway and River Road by Wednesday, City Manager Cindy Ogle said. Side streets will reopen later, she said.</p><p>A curfew will be in place again Thursday from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.</p><div id="module-position-Pl3sK0WodZ4" class="story-asset gallery-asset"><p class="card-film inactive"/><p class="sidebar-gallery-btn active"/><div class="companion-story-gallery"><div class="companion-galleries embedded_story hasendslate galleries" data-gallery-id="94673232" data-title="Gatlinburg Fire from the Air and on the Ground:Gatlinburg Fire from the Air and on the Ground" data-seo-title="gatlinburg-fire-from-the-air-and-on-the-ground" data-ssts="news/local" data-cst="news/local" data-published-date="2016-11-30T13:06:31.2170000" data-topic="news_phone,news_tablet" data-gal-pageurl="http://www.commercialappeal.com/picture-gallery/news/local/2016/11/30/gatlinburg-fire-from-the-air-and-on-the-ground/94673232/"><div class="viewport gallery-viewport"><div class="slide gallery-viewport-slide endslate"><div class="gallery-photo-border"><div class="gallery-endslate"><h3 class="gallery-endslate-header">Like this topic?
